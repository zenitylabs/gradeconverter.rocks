# Grade Converter

Grade Converter is a rock climbing grade converter available at https://gradeconverter.rocks

The source code is available here so the rock climbing community can contribute to its accuracy. The initial version is derived from the Wikipedia table available here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)#Free_climbing_2

Grade Converter is implemented in Typescript so it can run solely in the browser, and eventually offline. This simplifies hosting the application. It makes use of [web components](https://www.webcomponents.org/), which may limit backward compatibility early on, but eventually all browsers will support web components, expanding compatibility.
